# ENUM OVERRIDES
#
# RegistryDescription => EnumName
#
# This file contains overrides for certain language names when creating enum values.
# It is unlikely that end users will use some of the more esoteric ones, but for
# more common modern languages like Greek, Occitan, Dogri, and Interlingua, this
# will spare the user some typing.
#
# Trailing whitespace is removed, so feel free to align for clarity.
# Octatherp is used for comments at the beginning of lines only.
# Remember that spaces will be removed ('Ancient Greek' -> Language::AncientGreek)
#
#
# Override Rule 1.
# Remove data information, but retain adjectives if present.

# to an individual language, not a family, so we shorten the likely one only.

# 3. Modify ambiguous reductions by using alternate names
#
##
# Kwa   stays  Kwa
# Kwa' becomes Bakwa (Kwa’ in Kwa’)
  Kwa'    =>   Bakwa
##
# Mbe   stays  Mbe
# Mbe’ becomes Mbo (from Mbə, said/spelled often as Mbo’)
  Mbe'    =>   Mbo

# 4. Correct Punctuation Oddities and/or common English names
# The general rule in code accidentally consumes apostropes as word breaks.
# This is a quick fix

# which is rather pointless to add as an enum.
